<p>The best ways to improve as a programmer are to 1) read a lot of code, <br>
    and 2) exercise your programming skills by solving problems. 
    In this completely project-based course, we'll work through various projects from start
     to finish by breaking down problems and solving them using Python. Along the way,
      we'll learn about some intermediate to advanced Python topics and see how we can apply 
      concepts we've already learned to solve completely different problems. </p>
